# Emergency-Responce-System
A console-based Emergency Response System developed in C that manages Fire, Accident, and Crime emergencies using a priority queue. It simulates dynamic traffic conditions and applies Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the fastest response route while dispatching appropriate emergency units and logging operations with timestamps.
