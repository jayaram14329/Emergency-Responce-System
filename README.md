# Emergency Response System

Overview  
The Emergency Response System is a console-based application developed to simulate how emergency situations are handled in real life. The system receives emergency requests, identifies the type of emergency, assigns priority, and dispatches the appropriate emergency service such as police, ambulance, or fire services. All operations are logged with timestamps to ensure accountability and tracking.

Problem Statement  
During emergencies, delays and improper coordination can lead to serious consequences. Manual handling of emergency requests may result in slow response times and errors. This project aims to automate the emergency handling process to ensure faster, organized, and reliable responses.

Objectives  
- To automate emergency request handling  
- To prioritize emergencies based on severity  
- To dispatch appropriate emergency services  
- To maintain logs with date and time  
- To demonstrate real-world application of data structures  

Features  
- Handles multiple emergency types such as Fire, Accident, Crime, and Medical  
- Uses priority-based emergency processing  
- Simulates fastest response route calculation  
- Logs all emergency activities with timestamps  
- Simple and user-friendly console interface  

Technologies and Concepts Used  
- Priority Queue  
- Fastest Route or Shortest Path Logic  
- Conditional and Modular Programming  
- File Handling  
- Date and Time Processing  

How It Works  
The user enters emergency details, the system classifies the emergency, assigns priority, calculates the fastest route, dispatches appropriate emergency units, and logs all actions with timestamps.

Future Enhancements  
Integration with GPS, database storage, web or mobile interface, alert notifications, and AI-based emergency prioritization.

Conclusion  
The Emergency Response System demonstrates an efficient and structured approach to managing emergency situations using automation and logic. It highlights the importance of quick decision-making and organized response in life-critical scenarios.
